== Description ==

Displet Pop shows a pop-up window on a specified page load after a specified time elapses, prompting visitors to complete a contact form or other action. Uses a week long cookie to avoid over-pestering. Integrates with Gravity Forms and other form builders, and is very effective to encourage newsletter registration or to display a welcome message to your visitors.

Displet Pop comes with a number of options, including:

1) How many seconds to wait before displaying.

2) On which pageview to display the window to your visitors.

3) A path to restrict the light window to display on. (Ex. "Only display on pages with /idx/ in the path.")

4) Four separate areas to add text.

5) Six pre-designed light window styles or the option to use a custom stylesheet.

6) Choose whether or not to display the pop-up on handhelds and/or tablets (or not.)

== Installation ==

1. Install from the repository and activate the plugin from the Wordpress plugins screen.
2. Go to Displet Tools > Displet Pop and add your settings.
3. Go to Appearance > Widgets and insert whatever widget you would like (most likely a contact form) into your new Displet Pop widget area.
